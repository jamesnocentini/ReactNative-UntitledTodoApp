# Introducing the React Native Couchbase Lite Module

Recently, we published a series of articles on the topic of using Couchbase Lite in a React Native application. In this tutorial, we’ll take it one step further and use the recommended [Couchbase Lite Module](https://github.com/fraserxu/react-native-couchbase-lite) for React Native (available as an [npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-couchbase-lite)). You will learn the following core concepts:

- Creating, deleting a database and documents within it
- Using Couchbase Views to display List documents by date
- Replications with Basic Authentication
- Creating Sync Gateway Users and using a Sync Function

## Getting Started

To save some time, I’ve already put together a starter project which contains all the UI code and can be found [here](http://google.com). Go ahead and download it to your preferred directory and unzip the content. First, install the dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

If it’s not already the case, also make sure to have the React Native CLI globally installed:

```
$ npm install react-native -g
```

Next, start the React Native daemon:

```
$ react-native start
```

Open the Xcode project at `ios/UntitledTodoApp.xcodeproj` and run it in the simulator or device from Xcode. Check that everything is working as expected:

Don’t forget to enable LiveReload using the `Cmd+D` shortcut (and Chrome Debugging might be handy at times!):

## Local Persistence with Couchbase Lite

The starter project already contains the React Native Couchbase Lite Module (you can follow the [repo instructions](https://github.com/fraserxu/react-native-couchbase-lite) to use it in another React Native project). In this section, you will learn how to instantiate a new manager, database and persist documents locally.

Create a new file in `src/database.js` and paste the following:

```js
// 1
import {manager, ReactCBLite} from 'react-native-couchbase-lite';

// 2
ReactCBLite.init(5984, 'admin', 'pass');

// 3
var database = new manager('http://admin:pass@localhost:5984/', 'myapp');

// 4
module.exports = database;
```

The code does the following:

1. Import the `manager` and `ReactCBLite` objects from the module using the [de-structuring assignment syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) in ES6.
2. Start the Couchbase Lite Listener which serves an HTTP REST API that you will use later.
3. Instantiate a manager instance passing the URL of the embedded server and the desired database name. 
4. Export the object so it can be used throughout the application life-cycle.

Now you can turn your focus to `components/Login.js`. Add a require statement to use the database object from the previous step:

```js
var database = require('./../database');
```

This component has two input fields and a button, you’re going to add some code to check that the user is indeed registered before opening the List View. Replace the body of `_onLoginButtonPressed` with the following:

```js
var remote = `http://${this.state.username}:${this.state.password}@localhost:4984/todos`;
var credentials = this.state;
database.createDatabase()
  .then((res) => {
    database.replicate('myapp', remote, true);
    database.replicate(remote, 'myapp', true);
    var todoViews = {
      lists: {
        "map": function (doc) {
          emit(doc.created_at, doc);
        }.toString()
      }
    };
    database.createDesignDocument("_design/todo", todoViews);
  }).catch((err) => {
    throw err
  });
var data = {username: credentials.username};
this.props.navigator.push({id: 2, data: data});
```

You’re creating the database and then registering a design document with a view to query documents by their `created_at` property.

Next, open `Lists.js` and require the database object once more:

```
var database = require('./../database');
```

In the `render` method, notice the 2 variables `leftButtonConfig` and `rightButtonConfig` that are used in the NavigationBar component in the return statement. They correspond to the **Log Out** and **New** buttons. The click handlers don’t do anything though so you will change that right away. In the `handler` field of the object literal `leftButtonConfig` add:

```js
database.deleteDatabase()
  .then((res) => {
    if (res.ok) {
      this.props.navigator.pop();
    }
  });
```

You’re simply deleting the database (and all the documents and potential replication in progress with it) and then returning to the LogIn View.

Next, in the `handler` for the `rightButtonConfig` add:

```js
AlertIOS.alert(
  'New List Title',
  null,
  [
    {
      text: 'Save',
      onPress: (text) => {
        database.createDocument({
          type: 'list',
          title: text,
          owner: that.props.data.username,
          created_at: new Date().getTime()
        });
      }
    },
    {
      text: 'Cancel',
      style: 'cancel'
    }
  ],
  'plain-text'
);
```

In this case, you’re displaying an alert dialog to enter the new list title and then persisting it to the database (with the `owner` field set to the logged in user and `created_at` field as the current timestamp).

Next, below the `getInitialState` method add the following to query the persisted documents:

```
_redrawListView: function() {
  // 1
  database.queryView('_design/todo', 'lists')
    .then((res) => {
      this.setState({
        dataSource: this.state.dataSource.cloneWithRows(res.rows)
      });
    });
},
componentWillMount: function() {
  // 2
  var that = this;
  that._redrawListView();
  this.interval = setInterval(function () {
    that._redrawListView();
  }, 100);
},
// 3
componentWillUnmount: function() {
  clearInterval(this.interval);
},
```

Here's the breakdown of what is happening:

1. `_redrawListView` is a private method that queries the `lists` view and updates the datasource to display the new rows (if any) on the screen.
2. In `componentWillMount` you’re using the `setInterval` to check for new documents periodically and update the UI.
3. Stop the interval method when the component unmounts (i.e. when returning to the LogIn View).

Log the View Query result when the promise `queryView` is fulfilled, you will see a lot of output in the Chrome Console. The result of this View Query has the following JSON (you can also see in from any browser at [http://localhost:5984/myapp/\_design/todo/\_view/lists](http://localhost:5984/myapp/_design/todo/_view/lists) with `admin` for the username and `password` for the password):

```js
{
   "offset":0,
   "rows":[
      {
         "key":1452038776654,
         "value":{
            "owner":"james",
            "_id":"-_XbsYkL8LNqVDSMuZceW71",
            "_rev":"1-e62876578d58bcdef321bb50470debf4",
            "created_at":1452038776654,
            "title":"Groceries",
            "type":"list",
            "_local_seq":2
         },
         "id":"-_XbsYkL8LNqVDSMuZceW71"
      },
      ...
   ],
   "total_rows":2
}
```

To display them on the screen you will use the `ListView` component. It has two mandatory attributes:

- `dataSource` to provide the data: you can pass `this.state.dataSource` here.
- `renderRow` takes a function that returns a `View` object given a list item.

You’re missing the method to draw the row, below `render`, add a `renderRow` method with the following:

```js
renderRow: function(list) {
  var list = list.value;
  return (
    <View style={styles.listCell}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>{list.title}</Text>
      <Text style={styles.owner}>{list.owner}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

The desired data is held in the `value` field and you’re displaying the title and owner fields in `Text` elements. Back in the return statement of the `render` method, add the `ListView` below the `NavigationBar` component:

```
<View style={styles.container}>
  <NavigationBar
    title={titleConfig}
    leftButton={leftButtonConfig}
    rightButton={rightButtonConfig}
    tintColor="#ED2226"></NavigationBar>
  <ListView
    dataSource={this.state.dataSource}
    renderRow={this.renderRow} />
</View>
```

Persist documents and notice the screen updating itself:

## Sync Gateway Configuration

In this section, you will use Sync Gateway to introduce bi-directional synchronization and server-side user authentication so multiple users can log in. First, download Sync Gateway from [here](http://www.couchbase.com/nosql-databases/downloads) and in the root directory of the project, create a new file named `sync-gateway-config.json` with the following JSON:

```js
{
  "log": ["*"],
  "databases": {
    "todos": {
      "users": {
        "moderator": {"password": "pass", "admin_channels": ["*"]},
        "laura": {"password": "pass"},
        "james": {"password": "pass"},
        "adam": {"password": "pass"}
      },
      "sync": `function(doc, oldDoc) {
        var channelname = "chan_" + doc.owner
        channel(channelname);
        access(doc.owner, channelname);
      }`
    }
  }
}
```

A few important things to note here are:

- The `GUEST` mode is disabled (in fact, it’s the case by default) so any unauthenticated requests will be treated as unauthorized and return a 401 status code. For that matter, 4 different users have been created (with names moderator, laura, james, adam). The user named **moderator** has access to all channels.
- The Sync Function routes a document to a channel named after the `owner` field and grants the `owner` access to that channel.

So, in theory, the **moderator** should see all List documents where as the **other users** will see their own List documents only.

Start Sync Gateway from the command line:

```
$ ~/Downloads/couchbase-sync-gateway/bin/sync_gateway ./sync-gateway-config.json
```

In `Login.js`, update the `_onLoginButtonPressed` as follow:

```js
// 1 - Request configuration
var remote = `http://${this.state.username}:${this.state.password}@localhost:4984/todos`;
var credentials = this.state;
var settings = {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: credentials.username,
    password: credentials.password
  })
};
var that = this;
// 2 - Check that the name/password are valid
fetch(remote + '/_session', settings)
  .then((res) => {
    switch (res.status) {
      case 200:
        // 3 - Bootstrap application
        database.createDatabase()
          .then((res) => {
            database.replicate('myapp', remote, true);
            database.replicate(remote, 'myapp', true);
            var todoViews = {
              lists: {
                "map": function (doc) {
                  emit(doc.created_at, doc);
                }.toString()
              }
            };
            database.createDesignDocument("_design/todo", todoViews);
          }).catch((err) => {
            throw err
          });
        
        var data = {username: credentials.username};
        that.props.navigator.push({id: 2, data: data});
        break;
      case 401:
        // 4 - Wrong credentials
        alert('User not found or password incorrect');
        break;
      default:
        break;
    }
  });
```

Here’s what is happening:

1. Construct the URL of the remote database (in this case it’s a Sync Gateway database) and set the name/password JSON fields in the request body.
2. Use the POST /\_session endpoint to check the name/password.
3. If the credentials are valid, create the database and once that’s done kick off continuous push/pull replications and register a design document with a view to query document by their `created_at` property.
4. If the credentials are invalid, display an alert window.

Run the application and login as different users. If possible, run the app on two devices to observe the continuous replication and different read permissions for the moderator:

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learnt how to use the React Native Couchbase Lite module to build a simple Todo application where multiple users can log in. As an exercise, you can try the following:

- Instead of creating a database with a hardcoded name when the user logs in, create a different one for each user. By doing so, you can simply switch database between users.
- Use a [local document](http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/1.1.0/develop/references/couchbase-lite/rest-api/local-document/index.html) to persist the user credentials and check if the user already logged in on app launch.

The final project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/jamiltz/ReactNative-UntitledTodoApp).
